#C - argc, argv
argc stands for "argument count." It represents the number of arguments passed to the program when it's executed, including the name of the program itself.
argv stands for "argument vector." It's an array of strings (char*) where each element represents one of the arguments passed to the program. argv[0] is the name of the program, and argv[1] to argv[argc-1] contain the actual arguments provided by the user.
